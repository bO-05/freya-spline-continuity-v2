# Bézier Curves

Bézier curves are a fundamental building block in the world of computer graphics and design. Named after French engineer Pierre Bézier, these curves are widely used to create smooth, organic shapes in various applications, from typography to animation.

At their core, Bézier curves are parametric curves that use a set of control points to define their shape. By manipulating these control points, designers and artists can create a wide range of curves with different levels of complexity and smoothness.

In this section, we'll explore the various types of Bézier curves and their properties:

- [Linear Interpolation (Lerp)](/bezier-curves/lerp): The foundation of creating smooth curves.
- [Quadratic and Cubic Bézier Curves](/bezier-curves/quadratic-cubic-bezier): The most commonly used Bézier curves in computer graphics.
- [N-Degree Bézier Curves](/bezier-curves/n-degree-bezier): Generalizing Bézier curves to higher degrees and understanding their limitations.

As we dive deeper into the world of Bézier curves, you'll gain a solid understanding of how they work and why they are so important in the realm of digital art and design. By mastering these curves, you'll be able to create smooth, visually appealing shapes that can be used in a wide range of applications.

So, let's begin our journey into the fascinating world of Bézier curves!
