# Local Control and Flexibility

One of the key advantages of using BÃ©zier splines is the **local control** they provide over the shape of the curve. This means that when you modify a control point, only a specific portion of the spline is affected, leaving the rest of the curve unchanged. This is in contrast to [higher-degree BÃ©zier curves](/bezier-curves/n-degree-bezier), where moving a single control point can alter the entire curve.

Local control is achieved through the careful arrangement of control points and their influence on the spline. By analyzing the basis functions of a cubic BÃ©zier spline, we can observe how each control point affects the curve:

- The influence of a control point that lies between two curve segments is limited to those segments only.
- A control point shared by two curve segments has twice the influence, but its effect is still confined to those two segments.

This localized influence allows for precise control over the shape of the spline without unintended consequences on distant parts of the curve.

The local control property of BÃ©zier splines is essential for creating complex shapes in various applications, such as defining roads in games or crafting intricate designs in vector graphics.

## Flexibility in Shaping Curves

In addition to local control, BÃ©zier splines offer remarkable flexibility in shaping curves. By strategically placing and adjusting the control points, you can create a wide range of shapes, from smooth curves to sharp corners. This flexibility is largely due to the arrangement of the two control points adjacent to each curve joint, known as **tangent points**.

There are three common configurations for tangent points, each with different properties:

1. **Split Tangents (Broken Tangents)**: By placing the tangent points in opposite directions, you can create sharp corners or cusps in the spline.

2. **Aligned Tangents**: When the three points around a curve joint are aligned, the two curves will be tangent to each other at that joint, resulting in a smooth transition.

3. **Mirrored Tangents**: If the tangent points are not only aligned but also equidistant from their shared control point, the spline will have [CÂ¹ continuity](/continuity/parametric-continuity) at that joint.

### Approximating Shapes

BÃ©zier splines can closely approximate various shapes, including circles. Although they cannot create perfect circles, you can achieve a very close approximation by carefully placing the control points.

### Creating Linear Segments

If you want to include straight line segments in your BÃ©zier spline, you can do so by placing the middle two control points at exactly one-third of the distance between the endpoints of the segment.

The flexibility of BÃ©zier splines makes them a popular choice for a wide range of applications, such as:

- Defining paths and curves in vector graphics software (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape)
- Creating smooth, scalable fonts using BÃ©zier curves
- Modeling 3D surfaces in computer-aided design (CAD) software

By leveraging the local control and flexibility of BÃ©zier splines, designers and artists can create complex, smooth shapes with precision and efficiency.
