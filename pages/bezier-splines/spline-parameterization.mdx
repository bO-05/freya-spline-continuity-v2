# Spline Parameterization

When working with [Bézier splines](/bezier-splines), understanding how to traverse the curves is crucial. This is where *spline parameterization* comes into play.

In a single Bézier curve, the input parameter (often called $t$) ranges from 0 to 1, representing the start and end points of the curve. However, when dealing with a spline composed of multiple curves, we need to extend this concept to cover the entire spline.

## Introducing the $u$ parameter

To parameterize a Bézier spline, we introduce a new input parameter called $u$. The $u$ parameter spans the entire spline, with each curve occupying a specific interval.

### Step 1: Map curves to whole numbers

We can easily map each curve in the spline to a whole number. For example, in a spline with three curves, the intervals would be [0, 1], [1, 2], and [2, 3].

### Step 2: Determine the curve index and local $t$ value

The integer part of the $u$ parameter represents the curve index, while the fractional part represents the local $t$ value within that curve.

For instance, if $u = 1.5$, it means we're dealing with the second curve (index 1) and the local $t$ value is 0.5.

By using this parameterization method, we can easily traverse the entire spline and evaluate any point along its path.

## Uniform splines and knot intervals

In this article, we focus on *uniform splines*, where the intervals between the curves (called *knot intervals*) have the same length. This simplifies the parameterization process, as each curve maps directly to the unit interval [0, 1].

Non-uniform splines, where the knot intervals vary in length, are more complex and will be covered in a future article.

By understanding spline parameterization, you can easily navigate through the curves of a Bézier spline and create smooth, continuous paths. This concept is fundamental to working with splines in various applications, such as computer graphics, animation, and design.

Next, let's dive deeper into the [anatomy of a spline](/bezier-splines/spline-anatomy) to understand its components and how they work together.
