# Conclusion

In this deep dive into the continuity of splines, we've explored the fascinating world of curves and their mathematical foundations. From the humble beginnings of linear interpolation to the complex realm of B-splines, we've seen how different spline types achieve varying levels of smoothness and control.

We started our journey with **Bézier curves**, understanding how they are constructed using linear interpolation and the limitations of higher-degree curves. This led us to the introduction of **Bézier splines**, which provided a solution to these limitations by joining multiple curves together while maintaining local control and flexibility.

The concept of **continuity** took center stage as we delved into parametric and geometric continuity. We learned about the different levels of continuity (C⁰, C¹, C², C³, G¹, G², G³) and their implications on the smoothness and appearance of splines. Techniques such as velocity graphs, curvature combs, and the reflection test helped us analyze and visualize continuity in action.

Our exploration of the extended spline universe introduced us to various spline types, each with its unique properties and applications:

- **[Hermite splines](/extended-spline-universe/hermite-splines)**: Interpolating points with specific velocities
- **[Cardinal and Catmull-Rom splines](/extended-spline-universe/cardinal-catmull-rom-splines)**: Variants of Hermite splines with automatic tangent calculation
- **[B-splines](/extended-spline-universe/b-splines)**: Achieving higher levels of continuity and their applications in industrial design
