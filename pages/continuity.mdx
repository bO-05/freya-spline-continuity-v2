# Continuity

Continuity is a crucial concept in the world of splines, as it determines how smoothly the curves connect and transition from one to another. The smoother the continuity, the more seamless and visually appealing the resulting shape or motion will be.

When we talk about continuity in the context of splines, we're referring to two main types: **parametric continuity** and **geometric continuity**. Parametric continuity focuses on the continuity of the spline's parameters, such as position, velocity, and acceleration, while geometric continuity deals with the visual smoothness of the curve itself.

Understanding continuity is essential for creating high-quality curves and surfaces in various fields, including computer graphics, animation, and industrial design.

In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into:

- [Parametric Continuity](/continuity/parametric-continuity): Exploring the different levels of parametric continuity (C⁰, C¹, C², C³) and their implications on spline smoothness.
- [Geometric Continuity](/continuity/geometric-continuity): Introducing geometric continuity (G¹, G², G³) and its significance in industrial design and reflective surfaces.
- [Continuity Analysis Techniques](/continuity/continuity-analysis): Demonstrating techniques for analyzing continuity, including velocity graphs, curvature combs, and the reflection test.

By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to create smooth, visually appealing curves and surfaces that meet the demands of your projects, whether you're working on computer graphics, animations, or designing sleek, reflective surfaces for industrial applications.
