# Extended Spline Universe

In the vast universe of splines, Bézier splines are just the tip of the iceberg. There are numerous other spline types, each with their unique properties and use cases. In this section, we'll explore some of the most popular spline types beyond Bézier splines.

## [Hermite Splines](/extended-spline-universe/hermite-splines)

Hermite splines offer a powerful way to interpolate points with specific velocities, making them ideal for animation and simulating physical objects.

## [Cardinal and Catmull-Rom Splines](/extended-spline-universe/cardinal-catmull-rom-splines)

These spline types are variations of Hermite splines that automatically calculate tangents based on neighboring points, providing a smooth and intuitive way to create paths.

## [B-Splines](/extended-spline-universe/b-splines)

B-splines are the go-to choice for achieving higher levels of continuity, making them essential in industrial design and creating smooth, reflective surfaces.
