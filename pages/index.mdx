# Introduction

Welcome to the fascinating world of splines! In this comprehensive exploration, we'll dive deep into the mathematical foundations and practical applications of these essential tools used in computer graphics, game development, and industrial design.

Splines are **everywhere** in the digital world, even if you might not realize it at first glance. From the smooth curves in your favorite video game character's animations to the sleek contours of a shiny new smartphone, splines play a crucial role in creating visually appealing and functional designs.

Throughout this journey, we'll uncover the secrets behind various types of splines, including:

- [Bézier curves](/bezier-curves)
- [Hermite splines](/extended-spline-universe/hermite-splines)
- [Cardinal and Catmull-Rom splines](/extended-spline-universe/cardinal-catmull-rom-splines)
- [B-splines](/extended-spline-universe/b-splines)

But we won't stop there! We'll also explore the crucial concept of **continuity**, which determines how smoothly these curves connect and transition from one to another. By understanding parametric and geometric continuity, you'll gain the power to create splines that are not only visually appealing but also mathematically sound.

Whether you're a programmer, game developer, technical artist, or simply curious about the mathematics behind digital curves, this in-depth exploration has something for you. So buckle up and get ready to unravel the mysteries of splines and their continuity!
